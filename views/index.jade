  h2 BIO
  p.
     I am currently an Honours Computer Science student at University of Waterloo 
     and I have had a strong passion for programming ever since I took
     my first class when I was 11. Over the past years I have accumulated
     programming experience in a broad range of areas from game development
     to image processing apps to web development. I am a self driven individual
     who one day aspires to start his own company.
