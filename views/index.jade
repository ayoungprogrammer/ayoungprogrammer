  h2 BIO
  p.
     I am currently a student at the University of Waterloo in the Honours 
     Computer Science program. I have had a strong passion for programming 
     since I attended my first class at 11. Over the past years I have accumulated
     programming experience in a broad range of areas from game development
     to image processing apps to web development. I am self-driven, determined and 
     aspire to one day start my own company.
